# Introduction {#introduction}

This document describes SPAKE2+, a Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol
run between two parties for deriving a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.
SPAKE2+ is an augmented PAKE protocol, as only one party makes direct use of the password during the execution of the protocol.
The other party only needs a verification value at the time of the protocol execution instead of the password.
The verification value can be computed once, during an offline initialization phase.
The party using the password directly would typically be a client, and acts as a prover,
while the other party would be a server, and acts as verifier.

The protocol is augmented in the sense that it provides some resilience to the compromise or extraction of the verification value.
The design of the protocol forces the adversary to recover the password from the verification value to successfully execute the protocol.
Hence this protocol can be advantageously combined with a salted Password Hashing Function to increase the cost of the recovery and slow down attacks.
The verification value cannot be used directly to successfully run the protocol as a prover,
making this protocol more robust than balanced PAKEs which don't benefit from Password Hashing Functions to the same extent.

This augmented property is especially valuable in scenarios where the execution of the protocol is constrained
and the adversary can not query the salt of the password hash function ahead of the attack.
Constraints may consist in being in physical proximity through a local network or
when initiation of the protocol requires a first authentication factor.

This password-based key exchange protocol appears in {{TDH}} and is proven secure in {{UCAnalysis}}.
It is compatible with any prime-order group and relies only on group operations, making it simple and computationally efficient.
Predetermined parameters for a selection of commonly used groups are also provided.

This document has content split out from a related document specifying SPAKE2 {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}.

# Requirements Notation

# Definition of SPAKE2+

## Offline Initialization {#setup}

Let G be a group in which the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH)
problem is hard. Suppose G has order p\*h where p is a large prime;
h will be called the cofactor. Let I be the unit element in
G, e.g., the point at infinity if G is an elliptic curve group. We denote the
operations in the group additively. We assume there is a representation of
elements of G as byte strings: common choices would be SEC1
uncompressed or compressed {{SEC1}} for elliptic curve groups or big
endian integers of a fixed (per-group) length for prime field DH.
We fix two elements M and N in the prime-order subgroup of G as defined
in the table in this document for common groups, as well as a generator P
of the (large) prime-order subgroup of G. P is specified in the document defining
the group, and so we do not repeat it here.

|| denotes concatenation of strings. We also let len(S) denote the
length of a string in bytes, represented as an eight-byte little-
endian number. Finally, let nil represent an empty string, i.e.,
len(nil) = 0.

KDF is a key-derivation function that takes as input a salt, intermediate
keying material (IKM), info string, and derived key length L to derive a
cryptographic key of length L.
MAC is a Message Authentication Code algorithm that takes a secret key and
message as input to produce an output.
Let Hash be a hash function from arbitrary strings to bit strings of a fixed length. Common choices
for Hash are SHA256 or SHA512 {{!RFC6234}}.
Let PBKDF be a Password-Based Key Derivation Function designed to slow down brute-force attackers.
Brute-force resistance may be obtained through various computation hardness parameters such as memory or CPU cycles,
and are typically configurable.
Scrypt {{!RFC7914}} and Argon2 are common examples of PBKDF functions.
PBKDF and hardness parameter selection are out of scope of this document.
{{Ciphersuites}} specifies variants of KDF, MAC, and Hash
suitable for use with the protocols contained herein.

Let A and B be two parties. A and B may also have digital
representations of the parties' identities such as Media Access Control addresses
or other names (hostnames, usernames, etc). A and B may share additional data
(the context) separate from their identities which they may want to include in
the protocol transcript.
One example of additional data is a list of supported protocol versions if SPAKE2+ were
used in a higher-level protocol which negotiates the use of a particular PAKE. Another
example is the inclusion of PBKDF parameters and the application name.
Including those would ensure that both parties agree upon the same set of supported
protocols and use the same PBKDF parameters and therefore prevent downgrade and
cross-protocol attacks. Specification of precise context values is out of scope for this document.

## Protocol Flow {#flow}

SPAKE2+ is a two round protocol that establishes a shared secret with an
additional round for key confirmation. Prior to invocation, A and B are provisioned with
information such as the input password needed to run the protocol.
A preamble exchange may occur in order to communicate identities, protocol version and PBKDF parameters related to the verification value.
Details of the preamble phase are out of scope of this document.
During the first round, A, the prover, sends a public share pA
to B, the verifier, and B responds with its own public share pB. Both A and B then derive a shared secret
used to produce encryption and authentication keys. The latter are used during the second
round for key confirmation. ({{keys}} details the key derivation and
confirmation steps.) In particular, B sends a key confirmation message cB to A, and A responds
with its own key confirmation message cA. (Note that pB and cB MAY be sent in the same message.)
Both parties MUST NOT consider the protocol complete prior to receipt and validation of these key
confirmation messages.

A sample trace is shown below.

## SPAKE2+ {#spake2plus}

Let w0 and w1 be two integers derived by hashing the password pw with the
identities of the two participants, A and B. Specifically, compute
w0s || w1s = PBKDF(len(pw) || pw || len(A) || A || len(B) || B),
and then w0 = w0s mod p and w1 = w1s mod p.
If both identities A and B are absent, then w0s || w1s = PBKDF(pw), i.e.,
the length prefix is omitted as in {{setup}}.
If one or both identities A and B are unknown at the time of deriving w0 and w1,
w0s and w1s are computed as if the unknown identities were absent. They however
SHOULD be included in the transcript TT if the parties exchange those
prior to or as part of the protocol flow.
The party B stores the verification value pair L=w1\*P and w0.

Note that standards such as NIST.SP.800-56Ar3 suggest taking mod p of a
hash value that is 64 bits longer than that needed to represent p to remove
statistical bias introduced by the modulation. Protocols using this specification must define
the method used to compute w0 and w1: it may be necessary to carry out various
forms of normalization of the password before hashing {{!RFC8265}}.
The hashing algorithm SHOULD be a PBKDF so as to slow down brute-force
attackers.

When executing SPAKE2+, A selects x uniformly at random from the
numbers in the range [0, p), and lets X=x\*P+w0\*M, then transmits pA=X to
B. Upon receipt of X, B computes h\*X and aborts if the result is equal
to I. B then selects y uniformly at random from the numbers in [0, p),
then computes Y=y\*P+w0\*N, and transmits pB=Y to A. Upon receipt of Y,
A computes h\*Y and aborts if the result is equal to I.

A computes Z as h\*x\*(Y-w0\*N), and V as h\*w1\*(Y-w0\*N). B computes Z as
h\*y\*(X-w0\*M) and V as h\*y\*L. Both share Z and V as common values.
It is essential that both Z and V be used in combination with the transcript to
derive the keying material. The protocol transcript encoding is shown below.

~~~
TT = len(Context) || Context ||
  || len(A) || A || len(B) || B
  || len(M) || M || len(N) || N
  || len(X) || X || len(Y) || Y
  || len(Z) || Z || len(V) || V
  || len(w0) || w0
~~~

Context is an application-specific customization string shared between both
parties and MUST precede the remaining transcript. It might contain the
name and version number of the higher-level protocol, or simply the name and version
number of the application. The context MAY include additional data such as the
chosen ciphersuite and PBKDF parameters like the iteration count or salt.
The context and its length prefix MAY be omitted.

If an identity is absent, it is omitted from the transcript entirely. For example,
if both A and B are absent, then TT = len(Context) || Context || len(M) || M || len(N) || N || len(X) || X || len(Y) || Y || len(Z) || Z || len(w0) || w0.
Likewise, if only A is absent, TT = len(Context) || Context || len(B) || B || len(M) || M || len(N) || N || len(X) || X || len(Y) || Y || len(Z) || Z || len(w0) || w0.
This must only be done for applications in which identities are implicit. Otherwise,
the protocol risks Unknown Key Share attacks (discussion of Unknown Key Share attacks
in a specific protocol is given in {{?I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-uks}}.

Upon completion of this protocol, A and B compute shared secrets Ka, Ke, KcA,
and KcB as specified in {{keys}}. B MUST send A a key confirmation message cB
so both parties agree upon these shared secrets. This confirmation message cB
is computed as a MAC over the received share (pA) using KcB. Specifically, B
computes cB = MAC(KcB, pA), where MAC is also a secure PRF. After receipt and
verification of B's confirmation message, A MUST send B a confirmation message
using a MAC computed equivalently except with the use of pB and KcA. Key
confirmation verification requires recomputation of the MAC and checking
for equality against that which was received.

# Key Schedule and Key Confirmation {#keys}

The protocol transcript TT, as defined in {{spake2plus}},
is unique and secret to A and B. Both parties use TT to
derive shared symmetric secrets Ke and Ka as Ke || Ka = Hash(TT). The length of each
key is equal to half of the digest output, e.g., |Ke| = |Ka| = 128 bits for SHA-256.
If the required key size is less than half the digest output, e.g. when using SHA-512
to derive two 128-bit keys, the digest output MAY be truncated.

Both endpoints use Ka to derive subsequent MAC keys for key confirmation messages.
Specifically, let KcA and KcB be the MAC keys used by A and B, respectively.
A and B compute them as KcA || KcB = KDF(nil, Ka, "ConfirmationKeys")

The length of each of KcA and KcB is equal to half of the KDF
output, e.g., |KcA| = |KcB| = 128 bits for HKDF-SHA256. If half of the KDF
output size exceeds the required key size for the chosen MAC, e.g. when using
HKDF-SHA512 as the KDF and CMAC-AES-128 as the MAC, the KDF output MAY be truncated.

The resulting key schedule for this protocol, given transcript TT, is as follows.

~~~
TT -> Hash(TT) = Ka || Ke
Ka -> KDF(nil, Ka, "ConfirmationKeys") = KcA || KcB
~~~

A and B output Ke as the shared secret from the protocol. Ka and its derived keys (KcA and KcB)
are not used for anything except key confirmation.

# Ciphersuites {#Ciphersuites}

This section documents SPAKE2+ ciphersuite configurations. A ciphersuite
indicates a group, cryptographic hash algorithm, and pair of KDF and MAC functions, e.g.,
SPAKE2+-P256-SHA256-HKDF-HMAC. This ciphersuite indicates a SPAKE2+ protocol instance over
P-256 that uses SHA256 along with HKDF {{!RFC5869}} and HMAC {{!RFC2104}}
for G, Hash, KDF, and MAC functions, respectively.

# IANA Considerations

No IANA action is required.

# Security Considerations

SPAKE2+ appears in {{TDH}} and is proven secure in {{UCAnalysis}}.

Beyond the cofactor multiplication checks to ensure that elements received from
a peer are in the prime order subgroup of G, they also MUST be checked for group
membership as failure to properly validate group elements can lead to attacks.

The choices of random numbers MUST BE uniform. Randomly generated values (e.g., x and y)
MUST NOT be reused; such reuse may permit dictionary attacks on the password.

# Algorithm used for Point Generation {#pointgen}

This section describes the algorithm that was used to generate
the points (M) and (N) in the table in {{Ciphersuites}}.

For each curve in the table below, we construct a string
using the curve OID from {{!RFC5480}} (as an ASCII
string) or its name,
combined with the needed constant, for instance "1.3.132.0.35
point generation seed (M)" for P-512.  This string is turned
into a series of blocks by hashing with SHA256, and hashing that
output again to generate the next 32 bytes, and so on.  This
pattern is repeated for each group and value, with the string
modified appropriately.

A byte string of length equal to that of an encoded group
element is constructed by concatenating as many blocks as are
required, starting from the first block, and truncating to the
desired length.  The byte string is then formatted as required
for the group.  In the case of Weierstrass curves, we take the
desired length as the length for representing a compressed point
(section 2.3.4 of {{SEC1}}),
and use the low-order bit of the first byte as the sign bit.
In order to obtain the correct format, the value of the first
byte is set to 0x02 or 0x03 (clearing the first six bits
and setting the seventh bit), leaving the sign bit as it was
in the byte string constructed by concatenating hash blocks.
For the {{!RFC8032}} curves a different procedure is used.
For edwards448 the 57-byte input has the least-significant 7 bits of the
last byte set to zero, and for edwards25519 the 32-byte input is
not modified.  For both the {{!RFC8032}} curves the
(modified) input is then interpreted
as the representation of the group element.
If this interpretation yields a valid group element with the
correct order (p), the (modified) byte string is the output.  Otherwise,
the initial hash block is discarded and a new byte string constructed
from the remaining hash blocks. The procedure of constructing a
byte string of the appropriate length, formatting it as
required for the curve, and checking if it is a valid point of the correct
order, is repeated
until a valid element is found.

The following python snippet generates the above points,
assuming an elliptic curve implementation following the
interface of Edwards25519Point.stdbase() and
Edwards448Point.stdbase() in Appendix A of {{RFC8032}}:
