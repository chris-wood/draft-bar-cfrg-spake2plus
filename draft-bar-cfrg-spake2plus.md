# Introduction {#introduction}

This document describes SPAKE2+, a Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol
run between two parties for deriving a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.
SPAKE2+ is an augmented PAKE protocol, as only one party makes direct use of the password during the execution of the protocol.
The other party only needs a record corresponding to the other party's registration at the time of the protocol execution instead of the password.
This record can be computed once, during an offline registration phase.
The party using the password directly would typically be a client, and acts as a prover,
while the other party would be a server, and acts as verifier.

The protocol is augmented in the sense that it provides some resilience to the compromise or extraction of the registration record.
The design of the protocol forces the adversary to recover the password from the record to successfully execute the protocol.
Hence this protocol can be advantageously combined with a salted Password Hashing Function to increase the cost of the recovery and slow down attacks.
The record cannot be used directly to successfully run the protocol as a prover,
making this protocol more robust than balanced PAKEs which don't benefit from Password Hashing Functions to the same extent.

This augmented property is especially valuable in scenarios where the execution of the protocol is constrained
and the adversary cannot not query the salt of the password hash function ahead of the attack.
Constraints may consist in being in physical proximity through a local network or
when initiation of the protocol requires a first authentication factor.

This password-based key exchange protocol appears in {{TDH}} and is proven secure in {{SPAKE2P-Analysis}}.
It is compatible with any prime-order group and relies only on group operations, making it simple and computationally efficient.
Predetermined parameters for a selection of commonly used groups are also provided.

This document has content split out from a related document specifying SPAKE2 {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2}}.

# Requirements Notation

"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

# Definition of SPAKE2+

Let G be a group in which the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH)
problem is hard. Suppose G has order p\*h where p is a large prime;
h will be called the cofactor. Let I be the unit element in
G, e.g., the point at infinity if G is an elliptic curve group. We denote the
operations in the group additively. We assume there is a representation of
elements of G as byte strings: common choices would be SEC1
uncompressed or compressed {{SEC1}} for elliptic curve groups or big
endian integers of a fixed (per-group) length for prime field DH.
We fix two random elements M and N in the prime-order subgroup of G as defined
in the table in this document for common groups, as well as a generator P
of the (large) prime-order subgroup of G. The algorithm for selecting
M and N is defined in {{pointgen}}. Importantly, this algorithm chooses M
and N such that their discrete log is not known. P is specified in the
document defining the group, and so we do not repeat it here.

|| denotes concatenation of strings. We also let len(S) denote the
length of a string in bytes, represented as an eight-byte little
endian number. Finally, let nil represent an empty string, i.e.,
len(nil) = 0.

KDF is a key-derivation function that takes as input a salt, intermediate
keying material (IKM), info string, and derived key length L to derive a
cryptographic key of length L.
MAC is a Message Authentication Code algorithm that takes a secret key and
message as input to produce an output.
Let Hash be a hash function from arbitrary strings to bit strings of a fixed length. Common choices
for Hash are SHA256 or SHA512 {{!RFC6234}}.
{{Ciphersuites}} specifies variants of KDF, MAC, and Hash
suitable for use with the protocols contained herein.

Let there be two parties, a prover and a verifier. Their identities, denoted as
idProver and idVerifier, may also have digital representations such as Media Access Control addresses
or other names (hostnames, usernames, etc). The parties may share additional data
(the context) separate from their identities which they may want to include in
the protocol transcript.
One example of additional data is a list of supported protocol versions if SPAKE2+ were
used in a higher-level protocol which negotiates the use of a particular PAKE. Another
example is the inclusion of the application name. Including those would ensure that
both parties agree upon the same set of supported protocols and therefore prevent downgrade and
cross-protocol attacks. Specification of precise context values is out of scope for this document.

## Protocol Overview

SPAKE2+ is a two round protocol that establishes a shared secret with an
additional round for key confirmation. Prior to invocation, both parties are
provisioned with information such as the input password needed to run the
protocol. The registration phase may include communicating identities, protocol
version and other parameters related to the registration record; see
{{offline-registration}} for details.

During the first round, the prover sends a public share shareP to the verifier, which in turn
responds with its own public share shareV. Both parties then derive a shared secret
used to produce encryption and authentication keys. The latter are used during the second
round for key confirmation. ({{keys}} details the key derivation and confirmation steps.)
In particular, the verifier sends a key confirmation message confirmV to the prover,
which in turn responds with its own key confirmation message confirmP.
(Note that shareV and confirmV MAY be sent in the same message.)
Both parties MUST NOT consider the protocol complete prior to receipt and
validation of these key confirmation messages.

A sample trace is shown below.

## Offline Registration

The registration phase computes the values w0 and w1, as well as the registration
record L=w1\*P. w0 and w1 are derived by hashing the password pw with the identities
of the two participants. w0 and the record L are then shared with the verifier and
stored as part of the registration record associated with the prover. The prover
SHOULD derive w0 and w1 from the password before the protocol begins. Both w0 and
w1 are derived using a function with range [0, p-1], which is modeled as a random
oracle in {{SPAKE2P-Analysis}}.

Protocols using this specification MUST define the method used to compute w0 and w1.
For example, it may be necessary to carry out various forms of normalization of the
password before hashing {{!RFC8265}}. This section contains requirements and default
recommendations for computing w0 and w1.

The RECOMMENDED method for generating w0 and w1 is via a Password-Based Key
Derivation Function (PBKDF), which is a function designed to slow down brute-force
attackers. Brute-force resistance may be obtained through various computation hardness
parameters such as memory or CPU cycles, and are typically configurable.
Scrypt {{?RFC7914}} and Argon2id {{?RFC9106}} are common examples of PBKDFs.
Absent an application-specific profile, RECOMMENDED parameters (N, r, p)
for Scrypt are (32768,8,1), and RECOMMENDED parameters for Argon2id
are in Section 4 of {{?RFC9106}}.

Each half of the output of the PBKDF will be interpreted as an integer and reduced
modulo p. To control bias, each half must be of length at least ceil(log2(p)) + k
bits, with k >= 64. Reducing such integers mod p gives bias at most 2^-k for any
p; this bias is negligible for any k >= 64.

The minimum total output length of the PBKDF then is 2 * (ceil(log2(p)) + k) bits.
For example, given the prime order of the P-256 curve, the output of the PBKDF
SHOULD be at least 640 bits or 80 bytes.

Given a PBKDF, password pw, and identities idProver and idVerifier, the RECOMMENDED
method for computing w0 and w1 is as follows:

~~~
w0s || w1s = PBKDF(len(pw) || pw ||
                   len(idProver) || idProver ||
                   len(idVerifier) || idVerifier)
w0 = w0s mod p
w1 = w1s mod p
~~~

If an identity is unknown at the time of computing w0s or w1s, its length is given
as zero and the identity itself is represented as the empty octet string. If both
idProver and idVerifier are unknown, then their lengths are given as zero and both
identities will be represented as empty octet strings. idProver and idVerifier are
included in the transcript TT as part of the protocol flow.

## Online Authentication

The online SPAKE2+ protocol runs between the prover and verifier to produce a
single shared secret upon completion. To begin, the prover selects x uniformly
at random from the integers in [0, p-1], computes the public share shareP=X,
and transmits it to the verifier.

~~~
x <- [0, p-1]
X = x*P + w0*M
~~~

Upon receipt of X, the verifier checks the received element for group membership
and aborts if X is not in the large prime-order subgroup of G; see {{security}}
for details. The verifier then selects y uniformly at random from the integers
in [0, p-1], computes the public share shareV=Y and transmits it to the prover.
Upon receipt of Y, the prover checks the received element for group membership
and aborts if Y is not in the large prime-order subgroup of G.

~~~
y <- [0, p-1]
Y = y*P + w0*N
~~~

Both participants compute Z and V that are now shared as common values.
The prover computes:

~~~
Z = h*x*(Y - w0*N)
V = h*w1*(Y - w0*N)
~~~

The verifier computes:

~~~
Z = h*y*(X - w0*M)
V = h*y*L
~~~

The multiplication by the cofactor h prevents small subgroup confinement attacks.
All proofs of security hold even if the discrete log of the fixed group element
N is known to the adversary. In particular, one MAY set N=I, i.e. set N to the
unit element in G.

It is essential that both Z and V be used in combination with the transcript to
derive the keying material. The protocol transcript encoding is shown below.

~~~
TT = len(Context) || Context
  || len(idProver) || idProver
  || len(idVerifier) || idVerifier
  || len(M) || M
  || len(N) || N
  || len(shareP) || shareP
  || len(shareV) || shareV
  || len(Z) || Z
  || len(V) || V
  || len(w0) || w0
~~~

Context is an application-specific customization string shared between both
parties and MUST precede the remaining transcript. It might contain the
name and version number of the higher-level protocol, or simply the name and version
number of the application. The context MAY include additional data such as the
chosen ciphersuite and PBKDF parameters like the iteration count or salt.
The context and its length prefix MAY be omitted.

If an identity is absent, its length is given as zero and the identity itself
is represented as the empty octet string. If both identities are absent, then
their lengths are given as zero and both are represented as empty octet strings.
In applications where identities are not implicit, idProver and idVerifier SHOULD always be
non-empty. Otherwise, the protocol risks Unknown Key Share attacks (discussion
of Unknown Key Share attacks in a specific protocol is given in {{?I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-uks}}).

Upon completion of this protocol, both parties compute shared secrets K_auth,
K_enc, K_confirmP, and K_confirmV as specified in {{keys}}. The verifier MUST send a key
confirmation message confirmV to the prover so both parties can confirm that they
agree upon these shared secrets. After receipt and verification of the verifier's
confirmation message, the prover MUST respond with its confirmation message.
The verifier MUST NOT send application data to the prover until it has received
and verified the confirmation message. Key confirmation verification requires
recomputation of confirmP or confirmV and checking for equality against that which was
received.

## Key Schedule and Key Confirmation {#keys}

The protocol transcript TT, as defined in {{online-authentication}}, is unique and secret to
the participants. Both parties use TT to derive shared symmetric secrets K_auth
and K_enc and output K_enc as the shared secret from the protocol. The length of
each key is equal to half of the digest output, e.g., |K_auth| = |K_enc| = 128
bits for Hash() = SHA-256.

~~~
K_auth || K_enc = Hash(TT)
K_confirmP || K_confirmV = KDF(nil, K_auth, "ConfirmationKeys")
~~~

K_auth is used to derive K_confirmP and K_confirmV. The length of each confirmation key
is equal to half of the digest output, e.g., |K_confirmP| = |K_confirmV| = 128 bits for
Hash() = SHA-256. Neither K_auth nor its derived confirmation keys are used for
anything except key confirmation and MUST be discarded after the protocol execution.

Both endpoints MUST employ a MAC that produces pseudorandom tags for key confirmation.
K_confirmP and K_confirmV are symmetric keys used to compute tags confirmP and
confirmV over the public key shares received from the other peer earlier.

~~~
confirmP = MAC(K_confirmP, shareV)
confirmV = MAC(K_confirmV, shareP)
~~~

Once key confirmation is complete, applications MAY use K_enc as an authenticated
shared secret as needed. For example, applications MAY derive one or more AEAD
keys and nonces from K_enc for subsequent application data encryption.

# Ciphersuites {#Ciphersuites}

This section documents SPAKE2+ ciphersuite configurations. A ciphersuite
indicates a group, cryptographic hash algorithm, and pair of KDF and MAC functions, e.g.,
P256-SHA256-HKDF-HMAC-SHA256. This ciphersuite indicates a SPAKE2+ protocol instance over
P-256 that uses SHA256 along with HKDF {{!RFC5869}} and HMAC {{!RFC2104}}
for G, Hash, KDF, and MAC functions, respectively. Since the choice of PBKDF
and its parameters for computing w0 and w1 and distributing does not affect
interoperability, the PBKDF is not included as part of the ciphersuite.

If no MAC algorithm is used in the key confirmation phase, its respective column
in the table below can be ignored and the ciphersuite name will contain no MAC
identifier.

# IANA Considerations

No IANA action is required.

# Security Considerations {#security}

SPAKE2+ appears in {{TDH}} and is proven secure in {{SPAKE2P-Analysis}}.

The ephemeral randomness used by the prover and verifier MUST be
generated using a cryptographically secure PRNG.

Elements received from a peer MUST be checked for group membership: failure to
properly deserialize and validate group elements can lead to attacks. An endpoint
MUST abort the protocol if any received public value is not a member of the
large prime-order subgroup of G. Multiplication of a public value V by the
cofactor h will yield the identity element I whenever V is an element of a
small-order subgroup. Consequently, prover and verifier MUST abort the protocol 
upon of any received value V such that V\*h = I. Failure to do so may lead to subgroup
confinement attacks.

# Algorithm used for Point Generation {#pointgen}

This section describes the algorithm that was used to generate
the points M and N in the table in {{Ciphersuites}}. This algorithm
produces M and N such that they are indistinguishable from two random
elements in the prime-order subgroup of G. See {{SPAKE2P-Analysis}}
for additional details on this requirement.

For each curve in the table below, we construct a string
using the curve OID from {{!RFC5480}} (as an ASCII
string) or its name,
combined with the needed constant, for instance "1.3.132.0.35
point generation seed (M)" for P-512.  This string is turned
into a series of blocks by hashing with SHA256, and hashing that
output again to generate the next 32 bytes, and so on.  This
pattern is repeated for each group and value, with the string
modified appropriately.

A byte string of length equal to that of an encoded group
element is constructed by concatenating as many blocks as are
required, starting from the first block, and truncating to the
desired length.  The byte string is then formatted as required
for the group.  In the case of Weierstrass curves, we take the
desired length as the length for representing a compressed point
(section 2.3.4 of {{SEC1}}),
and use the low-order bit of the first byte as the sign bit.
In order to obtain the correct format, the value of the first
byte is set to 0x02 or 0x03 (clearing the first six bits
and setting the seventh bit), leaving the sign bit as it was
in the byte string constructed by concatenating hash blocks.
For the {{!RFC8032}} curves a different procedure is used.
For edwards448 the 57-byte input has the least-significant 7 bits of the
last byte set to zero, and for edwards25519 the 32-byte input is
not modified.  For both the {{!RFC8032}} curves the
(modified) input is then interpreted
as the representation of the group element.
If this interpretation yields a valid group element with the
correct order (p), the (modified) byte string is the output.  Otherwise,
the initial hash block is discarded and a new byte string constructed
from the remaining hash blocks. The procedure of constructing a
byte string of the appropriate length, formatting it as
required for the curve, and checking if it is a valid point of the correct
order, is repeated
until a valid element is found.

The following python snippet generates the above points,
assuming an elliptic curve implementation following the
interface of Edwards25519Point.stdbase() and
Edwards448Point.stdbase() in Appendix A of {{RFC8032}}:

# Test Vectors {#testvectors}

This section contains test vectors for SPAKE2+ using
the P256-SHA256-HKDF-HMAC-SHA256 and P256-SHA256-HKDF-CMAC-AES-128 ciphersuites.
