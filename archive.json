This implies that the device has to keep a potentially large amount of data in memory to be able to compute the transcript. An alternative would be to prepend the hash of the Context and the length of the hash of the Context to the transcript. This implies that as soon as these value are computed, the Context can be dropped. However, for the cases where the Context is small, this would be overkill because at the end, in these cases, the hashed Context would be bigger than the unhashed Context. A solution that would give the best of both worlds would be to state that if the Context size is smaller or equal to the size of the output of the Spake2+ selected hash function, the Context is prepended to the script and if the Context size is bigger than the size of the hash function output, the hash of the Context is prepended to the script.",

If not, a hash-to-curve algorithm might be necessary.\r\n\r\nPer the [security analysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/313.pdf), it's required that these are random group elements for which the DL is unknown. [Appendix A](https://chris-wood.github.io/draft-bar-cfrg-spake2plus/draft-bar-cfrg-spake2plus.html#section-appendix.a) describes the try-and-increment algorithm for generating these values, but its presentation could be improved. I don't think we should add a hash-to-curve dependency since (a) TAI is much simpler and (b) generation is not timing sensitive, but I'm open to hearing counterarguments.\r\n\r\n> * In 3.3: \"If both identities A and B are absent, i.e. len(A) = len(B) = 0, then the length prefixes are omitted as in Section 3.1.\". Would be clearer to just say: \"If both identities are absent, then w0s || w1s = PBKDF(pw)\". Risk of misunderstanding/misimplementation otherwise.\r\n\r\nNit acknowledged.\r\n\r\n> * In 3.3: The mod p reductions (as in \" w0 = w0s mod p\") can introduce a small statistical bias, as they discuss briefly. At the very end the draft further says \"The choices of random numbers MUST BE uniform.\". But nowhere does it say why, and what's the risk. \r\n\r\nThis is done for alignment with the [security analysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/313.pdf), which models the output of this as a random oracle. Any bias in the output would (I think) break that assumption. We can clarify this in the security considerations, with a forward pointer to match.\r\n\r\n> And just writing the specification as  \"w0 = w0s mod p\" is misleading when you say later that in fact w0 might have to be computed differently from w0s. I think this part needs clarification.\r\n\r\nGood point. We should make requirements for computing w0 and w1 more clear, and give a reasonable recommendation for computing them in the default case. We could fold in the bias explanation from the previous comment here, too.\r\n\r\n> * It would greatly help implementers to include examples of \"reasonable\" parameters for Scrypt and Argon2 when used as PBKDFs.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine suggestion. We can include some recommended parameters for both Scrypt and Argon2 in an appendix.\r\n\r\n> * In 5 (ciphersuites): strictly speaking, \"HMAC\" is not a MAC, guess they mean HMAC-SHA256 (with a key of some specific length). \r\n\r\nNit acknowledged -- we'll fix the ciphersuite column.\r\n\r\n> Also, why doesn't it include PBKDFs?\r\n\r\nUnless I'm missing something, choice of PBKDF and its parameters are not needed for interoperability, so they don't need to be in the suite.\r\n\r\ncc @ttaubert, @veorq",

However, some of those steps are out of order (for example, A\r\nchecks on the received value Y before B computes and sends it); I\r\nbelieve it would be clearer if you followed strict chronological order\r\n(and included the mandatory error checking in pseudocode, rather than\r\njust in text).\r\n\r\n\r\n *   In section 3.4, you also state:\r\n\r\n\r\n  All proofs of security hold even if the discrete log of the fixed\r\n  group element N is known to the adversary.  In particular, one MAY\r\n  set N=I, i.e. set N to the unit element in G.\r\n\r\n             If that is the case, then why just not mandate N=I always? \r\nAfter all, this simplifies the computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n *   The only other issue (which has been raised a number of times\r\nbefore) is the selection of a global M for a specific parameter set. \r\nWhile this is convenient, this also means that the protocol has a 'solve\r\none discrete log problem, break the entire system globally' property\r\nthat I cannot endorse.\r\n",

While this is convenient, this also means that the protocol has a 'solve one discrete log problem, break the entire system globally' property that I cannot endorse.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting point. I think we can address this by saying that implementations MAY generate M and N that meet the requirements, provided we list the requirements (DLOG is not known). We do this for M and N out of alignment with the security analysis, so I think we ought to keep this the same and not use the identity element for N. \r\n\r\n@ttaubert, what do you think? ",

As an example, consider two different protocols Foo and Bar. In Foo, A's identity is omitted. In Bar, B's identity is omitted. Moreover, assume that there exists a party acting as B in Foo with identity (name) N and a party acting as A in Bar with identity (name) N'. If N = N', and if the context string is omitted from both protocols, we can have a RO collision. \r\n\r\nIs this a problem?

              "body": "I wonder if it would be more clear if we were to write each step in terms of explicit functions, and then show how they're called? \r\n\r\nFor example, these might be the functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef ProverInit:\r\n   // Compute Prover key share\r\n   x <- [0, p-1]\r\n   X = x*P + w0*M\r\n   return (x, X)\r\n\r\ndef VerifierFinish(X):\r\n   if not_in_subgroup(X):\r\n      raise \"invalid input\"\r\n   \r\n   // Compute Verifier key share\r\n   y <- [0, p-1]\r\n   Y = y*P + w0*N\r\n   \r\n   // Compute shared values\r\n   Z = h*y*(X - w0*M)\r\n   V = h*y*L\r\n\r\n   return (Z, V)\r\n\r\ndef ProverFinish(x, Y):\r\n   if not_in_subgroup(Y):\r\n      raise \"invalid input\"\r\n\r\n   // Compute shared values\r\n   Z = h*x*(Y - w0*N)\r\n   V = h*w1*(Y - w0*N)\r\n\r\n   return (Y, Z, V)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then this might be how we describe the protocol:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProver:\r\n   (x, X) = ProverInit()\r\n   Transmit(X)\r\n   Y = Receive()\r\n   (Z, V) = ProverFinish(x, Y)\r\n   // ... write how to use (Z, V)?\r\n\r\nVerifier:\r\n   X = Receive()\r\n   (Y, Z, V) = VerifierFinish(X)\r\n   Transmit(Y)\r\n   // ... write how to use (Z, V)?\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I might just include this in an appendix, [similar to RFC8446](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#appendix-A).
